	<td><p>Apache Jackrabbit is a very useful content repository but a major obstacle for a novice JCR developer is that there is no demo application to be used as a reference. It would be really useful to new comers to Jackrabbit to have a reference which shows how to build an application from the scratch on top Jackrabbit.</p>

	<td><p> Apache Jackrabbit is a fully conforming implementation of the          Content Repository for Java Technology API (JCR). A content          repository is a hierarchical content store with support for          structured and unstructured content, full text search, versioning,          transactions, observation, and more. Typical applications that use          content repositories include content management, document management,          and records management systems. </p>
	  <p> Version 1.0 of the JCR API was specified by the <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170">Java Specification Request 170</a> (JSR 170) and work on the          JCR version 2.0 has begun in <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283">JSR 283</a>. </p>
    <p> Apache Jackrabbit is a project of the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>. </p>
